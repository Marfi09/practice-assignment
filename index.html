        <p class="likha">Bangladesh, country of South Asia, located in the delta of the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and
            Jamuna
            (Brahmaputra) rivers in the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent. The riverine country of Bangladesh
            (“Land of the Bengals”) is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and its people are
            predominantly Muslim. As the eastern portion of the historical region of Bengal, the area once formed, along
            with what is now the Indian state of West Bengal, the province of Bengal in British India. With the
            partition of India in 1947, it became the Pakistani province of East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan),
            one of five provinces of Pakistan, separated from the other four by 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of Indian
            territory. In 1971 it became the independent country of Bangladesh, with its capital at Dhaka.</p>

                    <p>The Padma enters Bangladesh from India near Nawabganj and meets the Jamuna (Bengali: যমুনা
                        Jomuna)
                        near
                        Aricha and retains its name, but finally meets with the Meghna (Bengali: মেঘনা) near Chandpur
                        and
                        adopts
                        the name "Meghna" before flowing into the Bay of Bengal.

                        Rajshahi, a major city in western Bangladesh, is situated on the north bank of the Padma.

                    <p>In Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra is joined by the Teesta River (or Tista), one of its largest
                        tributaries. The Teesta earlier ran due south from Jalpaiguri in three channels, namely, the
                        Karatoya to the east, the Punarbhaba in the west and the Atrai in the centre. The three channels
                        possibly gave the name to the river as Trisrota "possessed of three streams" </p>
